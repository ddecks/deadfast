        <p><strong>The Sovereign Individual</strong> by James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg is one of those books that either feels like prophecy or pretentious rambling, depending on when you read it. Rating: 7.8/10.</p>
<h2 id="the-central-thesis">The Central Thesis</h2>
<p>Written in 1997, the book predicts the rise of digital currencies, remote work, and the decline of nation-states. The authors argue that technology will eventually allow individuals to become &ldquo;sovereign&rdquo; - free from traditional government control and taxation.</p>
<h2 id="what-they-got-right">What They Got Right</h2>
<p>Looking back from 2024, it&rsquo;s honestly scary how much they nailed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Digital currencies</strong> - They predicted Bitcoin before Bitcoin existed</li>
<li><strong>Remote work revolution</strong> - COVID just accelerated what they saw coming</li>
<li><strong>Decline of traditional employment</strong> - The gig economy explosion</li>
<li><strong>Tax avoidance through technology</strong> - Digital nomads and crypto are making this real</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-feels-off">What Feels Off</h2>
<p>The book has this libertarian fantasy vibe that assumes everyone can just opt out of society. It&rsquo;s very much written from the perspective of wealthy individuals who have the luxury of choice.</p>
<p>The tone can be pretty elitist - there&rsquo;s this underlying assumption that only the &ldquo;cognitive elite&rdquo; will benefit from these changes, while everyone else gets left behind.</p>
<h2 id="the-crypto-connection">The Crypto Connection</h2>
<p>This book is basically required reading in crypto circles, and I can see why. The idea of programmable money that exists outside government control is central to their vision of sovereignty.</p>
<p>But reading it now, after seeing how crypto has actually played out, some of their optimism feels naive. Turns out governments are pretty good at adapting and regulating new technologies.</p>
<h2 id="why-its-still-relevant">Why It&rsquo;s Still Relevant</h2>
<p>Even if you disagree with their conclusions, the book makes you think about the relationship between technology, power, and individual freedom. In an age of increasing surveillance and government overreach, these questions matter.</p>
<p>The COVID response showed us how quickly governments can restrict movement and commerce. Maybe the authors were onto something about the need for alternative systems.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thought-provoking read that&rsquo;s aged better than most futurism books. Whether you buy into their vision or not, they were clearly thinking about trends that most people missed.</p>
<p>Worth reading if you&rsquo;re interested in economics, technology, or just want to understand why some people are so passionate about decentralization.</p>
<p>Just take the more extreme predictions with a grain of salt. The future is usually messier and more complicated than anyone predicts.</p>
